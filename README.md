# flask_app
 
 This is an example flask app to provide a common project for myself and a friend to fiddle with.

 No purpose has been yet identified, it's currently just some barebones stuff.

## Technologies

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)
	* I think i remember this being a thing webdevs use?
	* If you ain't into it, just yeet it if you want.
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
	* `pip install flask` after installing python
	* Templating uses [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#synopsis)
